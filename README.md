Generate react and react-native components.

## What makes this utility different?

If you search npm, you'll find many packages that do just about the same thing. Many have come before this one and built tools that generate your react components just fine. What makes this one different is that it seeks to simply do more.

1. Can generate single file components as well as a folder component.
2. Can generate as either React or React Native components.
3. Can generate as either .js or .ts for you TypeScript users.
4. Can generate a test folder with starter test files.

### Features to come:
1. Can generate both functional components as well as class based components.
2. Can generate stateful components with state setters and getters ready to go.
3. Can generate a redux connected component.
4. Can generate a react router connected component.
